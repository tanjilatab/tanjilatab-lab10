Driver: allows user to provide text via the terminal, a file, or directly to a method
1. a method called processText that expects a StringBuffer as argument (the text), and a String stopword, and counts the number of words in that text through that stopword
2. a method called processFile that expects a String path as an argument, and converts the contents of the file to a StringBuffer, which it returns.
3. a main method that asks the user to choose to process a file with option 1, or text with option 2
